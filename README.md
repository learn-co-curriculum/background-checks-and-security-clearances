# Background Checks and Security Clearances

**Background Checks**

Most companies make use of a pre-employment check system before hiring new employees.  Companies that handle sensitive information will be especially cautious when hiring new people. There are many reasons why it is helpful for employers to do background checks before hiring.  Employers need to verify that the information on your resume/CV is accurate. In the US, pre-employment screenings should not be in violation of any laws under the Equal Opportunity Employment Act.

Items contained within a background check may include: 
- Identity verification
- Criminal history 
- Driving record
- Credit check

To prevent Insider Threats moving forward, a company may opt to conduct continuous checks on a regular basis, screening for employees who have had recent developments in their lives that could pose a threat to the company. 
 
**Security Clearances** 
 
In the cybersecurity field, you could be tasked with handling very important or sensitive information, and because of this you may need to acquire a security clearance. While you do not need a security clearance to work in cybersecurity, many cybersecurity jobs connected to the government will require that you have clearance or are clearable. Jobs that require a clearance often pay more than similar, non-cleared positions: people with a security clearance are in the top 10 percent of wage earners in the US. There are two main types of security clearances: a Personnel Security Clearance (PCL), or a Facility Security Clearance (FCL). The only prerequisite to obtaining one of these clearances is you must be a U.S. citizen.

If you’re interested for the future in cybersecurity positions that will require a security clearance, start preparing well in advance. Keep your record and personal life as clean as possible.  A security clearance will involve a background check that will include an examination of your criminal record, driving record, financial status, relationships, contacts, foreign travel, and your overall reputation.

**What if I am denied a Security Clearance?**

This is not the end of your cybersecurity career!   A lot of jobs in the private sector do not require a clearance whatsoever.  If you have the necessary education, experience, and certifications needed for the job, you’ll be in good shape to find a non-cleared job.   If you are not a U.S. citizen, then this is your only job option, because you cannot obtain a clearance if you are not a U.S. citizen.  Some jobs will hire you without a clearance and help you obtain one while you are working there. If the employer requires you to be cleared, and they believe you are a good fit and worth the investment, they can and probably will sponsor you and help you obtain the clearance.
